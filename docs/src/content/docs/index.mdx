## Why Structure-Ts?

`Structure-Ts` brings Django's elegant architecture to the TypeScript ecosystem. If you love Django's **"batteries included"** philosophy but want TypeScript's type safety, Structure-Ts is built for you.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="🚀 Rapid Development" icon="rocket">
    Get your application running in minutes with sensible defaults and automatic configuration. Focus on building features, not boilerplate.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="📁 Modular Apps" icon="puzzle">
    Organize your code into self-contained applications. Each app manages its own routes, controllers, and models—making code reusable and maintainable.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="🛣️ Automatic Routing"
   icon="external">
    Define routes in your apps and let the framework handle registration automatically. No manual route configuration needed.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="🗄️ Database First" 
  icon="open-book">
    Built-in ORM support with migrations makes database management simple. Create models, generate migrations, and evolve your schema with confidence.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="🎨 Template Rendering" 
  icon="document">
    Render dynamic HTML pages using EJS templates. Layouts, partials, and data binding work seamlessly out of the box.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="⚙️ TypeScript Native" 
  icon="seti:typescript">
    Written in TypeScript from the ground up. Enjoy full type safety, autocompletion, and compile-time error checking throughout your application.

## Quick Example

Create a working API endpoint in seconds:

```typescript
// users/controllers.ts
import { type ControllerType, ok } from 'structure-ts';

export const listUsers: ControllerType = (question, reply) => {
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
  ];
  
  reply.status(ok()).json({
    success: true,
    data: users,
  });
};
```

```typescript
// users/routes.ts
import { Router } from 'structure-ts';
import { listUsers } from './controllers';

const { routes, route } = Router();

route.get('/', listUsers);

export default routes;
```

That's it! Your `/` endpoint is ready to serve data.

## Philosophy

Structure-Ts is built on three core principles:

**Convention over Configuration**  
Sensible defaults let you build applications without endless configuration files. Customize only what you need.

**App-Based Architecture**  
Organize code into modular apps, each handling a specific domain. Apps are self-contained, reusable, and easy to test.

**Developer Experience First**  
From TypeScript integration to automatic route registration, every decision prioritizes developer happiness and productivity.

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

| Feature | Structure-Ts | Express | Fastify | NestJS |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Built-in Structure | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Automatic Routing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| ORM & Migrations | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Learning Curve | Easy | Easy | Easy | Steep |
| Template Rendering | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| TypeScript First | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Lightweight | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Who Should Use Structure-Ts?

- **Django developers** wanting TypeScript's type safety
- **TypeScript developers** tired of setting up boilerplate
- **Teams** needing structure without NestJS complexity
- **Startups** building MVPs quickly with maintainable code
- **Anyone** who values convention and clean architecture
