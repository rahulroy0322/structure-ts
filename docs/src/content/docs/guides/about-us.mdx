Structure-Ts is a TypeScript web framework that brings Django's elegant architecture to the modern JavaScript ecosystem. This page tells the story of why and how it was built.

## The Story Behind Structure-Ts 

### The Problem

As developers, we've all been there: starting a new Node.js project and facing the same questions:
- How should I **organize my code**?
- Where do **routes** go?
- How do I **structure my database**?
- What **patterns** should I follow?

**Express and Fastify** give you freedom but no structure. Every project becomes a blank canvas, and that freedom turns into decision ~fatigue~. Teams end up with inconsistent codebases where everyone does things differently.

**NestJS** provides structure but brings heavy complexity. Decorators everywhere, dependency injection containers, Angular-like patterns—it's powerful but overwhelming, especially for small to medium projects.

There was a gap: **a framework with Django's elegance but TypeScript's type safety**.

### The Inspiration

Django got it right 20 years ago:
- **App-based architecture** keeps code organized
- **Convention over configuration** eliminates decision fatigue
- **Batteries included** means common tasks just work
- **Clear patterns** make code predictable and maintainable

Why not bring these principles to TypeScript?

### The Birth of Structure-Ts

Structure-Ts started as a personal project to solve a frustration: **`"Why can't building TypeScript backends be as pleasant as Django?"`**

The goals were clear:
1. **Django's architecture** for code organization
2. **TypeScript's type safety** for reliability
3. **Minimal boilerplate** for rapid development
4. **Easy learning curve** for Beginners

## Project Philosophy

### 1. Convention Over Configuration

You shouldn't configure your framework before building your app.

**Express approach:**

<Code
  code={
    `// Configure everything manually
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());
app.use(helmet());
// ... 50 more lines of setup`
  }
  lang='ts'
  title='app.{ts,js}'
/>

**Structure-Ts approach:**

<Code
  code={
    `// Just add your apps and go
const APPS = ['users', 'blog'];`
  }
  lang='ts'
  title='src/settings.ts'
/>

Sensible defaults work for 90% of use cases. Override only what you need.

### 2. App-Based Architecture

Large codebases are easier to manage when divided into focused modules.

<Code
  code={
    `users/      → Everything user-related
blog/       → Everything blog-related
api/        → Everything API-related`
  }
  lang='sh'
/>

Each app is **self-contained**, **reusable**, and **testable**. This pattern scales from **small** projects to **large** teams.

### 3. Developer Experience First

Every decision prioritizes developer happiness:
- **Clear error messages** tell you exactly what went wrong
- **TypeScript integration** catches bugs at compile-time
- **Automatic tools** handle repetitive tasks
- **Minimal magic** keeps behavior predictable

If it's **frustrating** to use, it need/time to **`change`**.

### 4. Simplicity Without Sacrificing Power

Structure-Ts doesn't dumb things down—it removes unnecessary complexity.

You can build:
- Simple APIs in minutes
- Complex applications over time
- Production-ready services

All without fighting the framework.

## What Makes Structure-Ts Different

### vs Express

**Express:**
- ✅ Minimal and flexible
- ❌ No structure or conventions
- ❌ Every project starts from scratch
- ❌ No built-in ORM or migrations

**Structure-Ts:**
- ✅ Minimal where it matters
- ✅ Built-in structure and conventions
- ✅ Start productive immediately
- ✅ ORM and migrations included

### vs Fastify

**Fastify:**
- ✅ Fast performance
- ❌ No structure
- ❌ Low-level abstractions
- ❌ Assembly required

**Structure-Ts:**
- ✅ Fast enough for most use cases
- ✅ High-level abstractions
- ✅ Batteries included
- ✅ Ready to use

### vs NestJS

**NestJS:**
- ✅ Well-structured
- ✅ Enterprise-ready
- ❌ Steep learning curve
- ❌ Heavy with decorators and DI(Dependencies Injection)
- ❌ Overkill for small/medium projects

**Structure-Ts:**
- ✅ Well-structured
- ✅ Gentle learning curve
- ✅ Lightweight
- ✅ Right-sized for most projects

### vs Django (Python)

**Django:**
- ✅ Excellent architecture
- ✅ Mature ecosystem
- ❌ Python (not JavaScript)
- ❌ No static typing (by default)

**Structure-Ts:**
- ✅ Django-inspired architecture
- ✅ TypeScript with static typing
- ✅ JavaScript ecosystem
- ⚠️ Younger ecosystem (growing)

## Technology Stack

Structure-Ts is built on solid foundations:

**Core:**
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and modern JavaScript
- **Node Http** - HTTP server layer
- **Custom Orm** - Database ORM and migrations
- **EJS** - Template rendering

**Development:**
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **CLI tools** - Project and app generation

**Testing:**
- **Node.js test runner** - Built-in testing (planned)

## Project Status

**Current Version:** 0.5.1 (Early Development)

**Stability:**

## Project Goals

see **[Plan](/guides/future-plans)** page for this

## Design Principles

These principles guide every decision:

**1. Developers First**  
If it's annoying or confusing, fix it. Developer experience matters more than clever code.

**2. Simple by Default, Powerful When Needed**  
Common cases should be trivial. Complex cases should be possible.

**3. Convention Over Configuration**  
Smart defaults eliminate decisions. Override only when necessary.

**4. Explicit Over Implicit**  
Code should be obvious. No magic that surprises developers.

**5. Learn Once, Use Everywhere**  
Patterns should be consistent across the framework.
