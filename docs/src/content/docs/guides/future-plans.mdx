description: Roadmap and upcoming features for structure-ts
---

{/* # Future Plans */}

This page outlines what's coming next for structure-ts. We're committed to making this framework better with each release while maintaining its simplicity and ease of use.
## Upcomming
{/* ## Development Philosophy 

Before diving into specific features, here's what guides our development:

**Keep It Simple**  
We won't add features that make the framework complex or hard to learn. Every addition must earn its place by solving real problems.

**Community-Driven**  
Your feedback shapes our roadmap. Features with the most demand get prioritized.

**Backward Compatibility**  
We'll maintain compatibility whenever possible. Breaking changes only happen in major versions with clear migration guides.

**Quality Over Speed**  
We'd rather ship polished features late than rushed features on time.

## Short Term (Next 1-3 Months)

These features are actively in development or planned for the next few releases.

### 🚧 Dynamic Route Parameters

**Status:** In Development  
**Priority:** High

Complete implementation of dynamic routing:
- Multiple parameters in routes (`/:userId/posts/:postId`)
- Optional parameters (`/:id?`)
- Parameter validation and constraints
- Better error messages for route conflicts

**Why:** Essential for building flexible APIs and applications.

### 🚧 Middleware Support

**Status:** In Development  
**Priority:** High

Add middleware layer for:
- Authentication checks
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- CORS handling
- Custom middleware

**Example:**
```typescript
// Planned API
route.get('/admin', adminController, [authMiddleware, adminMiddleware]);
```

**Why:** Common pattern needed for real-world applications.

### 📋 Request Validation

**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

Built-in validation for:
- Request body validation
- Query parameter validation
- Type coercion
- Custom validators

**Example:**
```typescript
// Planned API
route.post('/users', createUser, {
  body: {
    name: { type: 'string', required: true, minLength: 2 },
    email: { type: 'email', required: true },
    age: { type: 'number', min: 18 },
  },
});
```

**Why:** Reduce boilerplate validation code in controllers.

### 📋 File Upload Handling

**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

Native support for:
- File uploads (single and multiple)
- File size limits
- File type validation
- Streaming large files
- Integration with cloud storage

**Example:**
```typescript
// Planned API
const uploadAvatar: ControllerType = async (request, reply) => {
  const file = await request.file('avatar');
  // Process uploaded file
};
```

**Why:** Common requirement for modern web apps.

### 📋 Session Management

**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

Built-in session support:
- Cookie-based sessions
- Session storage (memory, Redis, database)
- Session middleware
- Flash messages

**Example:**
```typescript
// Planned API
const loginController: ControllerType = (request, reply) => {
  request.session.userId = user.id;
  request.session.save();
};
```

**Why:** Essential for authentication and stateful apps.

### 📋 Cookie Handling

**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium

Improved cookie support:
- Parse cookies automatically
- Set secure cookies
- Cookie signing
- SameSite configuration

**Example:**
```typescript
// Planned API
reply.setCookie('theme', 'dark', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  maxAge: 86400,
});
```

## Medium Term (3-6 Months)

### Authorization & Permissions

**Status:** Research Phase  
**Priority:** High

Permission system:
- Role-based permissions

  // Only authenticated users with posts:write permission
};
```

### Built-in Testing Utilities

**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High

Testing helpers:
- Test database setup/teardown
- Request/response mocking
- Factory functions for models
- Integration test helpers

**Example:**
```typescript

  method: 'GET',
  url: '/users',
});
```

### CLI Improvements

socket.on('connection', (client) => {
  client.on('message', (data) => {
    socket.broadcast(data);
  });
});
```

### API Documentation Generator
