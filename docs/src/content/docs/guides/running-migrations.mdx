Once you've created migrations, you need to run them to apply changes to your database. This guide covers everything about executing and managing migrations.

 ## Understanding Migration Execution

### What Happens When You Run Migrations

1. **Check Migration History**
   - Reads which migrations have already run
   - Stored in a `migrations` table in your database

2. **Find Pending Migrations**
   - Compares created migrations with migration history
   - Identifies which haven't run yet

3. **Run Pending Migrations**
   - Runs in timestamp order (oldest first)
   - Records completion in migration history

4. **Update Database**
   - Your database schema is now updated
   - Ready to use with your models

## Basic Migration Commands

### Running All Pending Migrations

<Code
  code={
    `st db:migrate`
  }
  title='terminal'
  lang="sh"
/>

or

<Code
  code={
    `stratus-ts db:migrate`
  }
  title='terminal'
  lang="sh"
/>


**What it does:**
- Runs all migrations that haven't been executed yet
- Runs them in chronological order
- Stops if any migration fails

## Next Steps

Now that you can run migrations:

- **[Models](/guides/models/)** - Use your migrated database schema
- **[Controllers](/guides/controllers/)** - Build features with your database
- **[Database Setup](/guides/database-setup/)** - Configure advanced database options *
