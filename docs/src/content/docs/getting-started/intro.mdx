import { Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Welcome to `StratusTS`! This page explains why this framework exists, what problems it solves, and whether it's the right choice for your project.

## The Problem

Building web applications with TypeScript often involves one of two extremes:

**Option 1: Minimal Frameworks (Express, Fastify)**
- Extremely flexible but lack `structure`
- Every project starts from `scratch`
- No `guidance` on `organizing` code as it grows
- Team members implement `patterns differently`
- Result: `Inconsistent codebases` that are hard to maintain

**Option 2: Heavy Frameworks (NestJS)**
- Highly structured but `complex`
- Steep learning curve with `decorators` everywhere
- `Overkill` for small to medium projects
- Heavy `dependency` on Angular-like patterns
- Result: `Slow development` for simple applications

**The Gap**: There's a missing middle ground—a framework that provides structure without overwhelming complexity.

## The Solution

**StratusTS** fills this gap by bringing Django's proven architecture to TypeScript:

- **Just enough structure** to keep code organized
- **Simple conventions** that make sense
- **Automatic configuration** for common tasks
- **Modular architecture** that scales with your project
- **Developer-friendly** without sacrificing power

Think of it as `"Django for TypeScript"` or `"Express with structure built-in."`

## Philosophy

StratusTS is built on three core beliefs:

### 1. Convention over Configuration

You shouldn't spend hours configuring your framework before writing a single line of business logic. StratusTS provides sensible defaults that work for **`90%`** of use cases.

<Code 
code={
  `
// Just add your app to APPS Array

const APPS: SettingsType['APPS'] = [
  'users' // That's it! Routes are auto-registered
]
  `
}
 lang="ts"
  title={'src/settings.ts'}
 mark={[`'users'`]} />

Need custom configuration? `Override` only what you need—nothing more.

### 2. App-Based Architecture

Large applications are easier to manage when divided into focused modules. Each "app" in StratusTS handles one domain:

<FileTree>
- muy-project/
  - src/
    - users/        # Everything user-related
    - blog/         # Everything blog-related
    - api/          # Everything API-related
</FileTree>

Apps are:
- **Self-contained**: Own routes, controllers, models
- **Reusable**: Move apps between projects
- **Testable**: Test apps independently
- **Scalable**: Add new apps without touching existing code

This pattern is proven—Django has used it successfully for nearly `Two decades`.

### 3. Developer Experience First

Every decision prioritizes making developers productive and happy:

- **TypeScript native**: Full type safety out of the box
- **Clear error messages**: Know exactly what went wrong
- **Minimal boilerplate**: Write logic, not configuration
- **Automatic tools**: CLI handles repetitive tasks
- **Familiar patterns**: Concepts from Django and Express

## Who Is This For?

StratusTS is ideal for:

**Django Developers Moving to TypeScript**
- Familiar app-based architecture
- Similar patterns for models, views (controllers), and routing
- Migrations work the same way

**TypeScript Developers Wanting Structure**
- Tired of reinventing project organization
- Want guidance without NestJS complexity
- Need structure that doesn't get in the way

**Teams Building Maintainable Applications**
- Need consistency across team members
- Want new developers to onboard quickly
- Value convention over tribal knowledge

**Startups and MVPs**
- Ship features rapidly
- Maintain code quality as you scale
- Iterate without technical debt

## Who Should Look Elsewhere?

StratusTS might not be the best fit if you:

- **Need ultra-high performance**: For extreme performance requirements, consider Fastify or raw Node.js
- **Prefer minimal frameworks**: Stick with Express or Fastify

{/* - **Need ultra-high performance**: For extreme performance requirements, consider Fastify or raw Node.js
- **Want microservices architecture**: Consider NestJS or multiple small services
- **Prefer minimal frameworks**: Stick with Express or Fastify
- **Need enterprise features**: Consider NestJS with its extensive ecosystem */}

Be honest with yourself about your needs—choosing the right tool matters more than using the **`"coolest"`** one.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation will teach you to:

1. **Set up projects** quickly with the CLI
2. **Create modular apps** that organize your code
3. **Build APIs** with controllers and routing
4. **Manage databases** with models and migrations
5. **Render templates** for server-side applications
6. **Structure code** that scales from prototype to production

## Learning Path

We recommend following this order:

1. **[Installation](/getting-started/installation/)** - Set up StratusTS
2. **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)** - Build your first app
3. **[Creating Apps](/guides/creating-apps/)** - Understand app architecture
4. **[Settings Configuration](/guides/settings-configuration/)** - Configure your project
5. **[Routing](/guides/routing/)** - Define URL patterns
6. **[Controllers](/guides/controllers/)** - Handle requests
7. **[Models](/guides/models/)** - Work with databases
8. **[Migrations](/guides/migrations/)** - Manage schema changes

Take your time—each concept builds on the previous one.

## What Makes StratusTS Different?

**Compared to Express:**
- Built-in structure and conventions
- Automatic route registration
- ORM and migrations included
- App-based code organization

**Compared to Fastify:**
- Higher-level abstractions
- Focus on rapid development
- Integrated template rendering
- Database management built-in

**Compared to NestJS:**
- Simpler learning curve
- Less boilerplate and decorators
- Lightweight and faster to set up
- Perfect for small to medium projects

**Compared to Django:**
- TypeScript with static typing
- Modern JavaScript ecosystem
- Async/await by default
- JSON APIs are first-class

## Core Features

StratusTS provides:

✅ **CLI Tools** - Generate projects, apps, and migrations  
✅ **Automatic Routing** - Register routes from apps  
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support  
✅ **ORM Integration** - Models and database management  
✅ **Migrations** - Version control for your schema  
✅ **Template Rendering** - Server-side HTML with EJS  
✅ **Controller Pattern** - Clean request/response handling  
✅ **Settings Management** - Centralized configuration  

## Example: Complete Feature in 5 Minutes

Let's see how quickly you can build a working feature:

<Code
  code={
    `// 1. Create app (1 minute)
st create app blog

// 2. Add to settings.ts (30 seconds)
const APPS = ['blog'];

// 3. Create controller (2 minutes)
// blog/controllers.ts
export const listPosts: ControllerType = (question, reply) => {
    const posts = [
      { id: 1, title: 'Hello World', author: 'Alice' },
      { id: 2, title: 'TypeScript Tips', author: 'Bob' },
    ];
    reply.status(ok()).json({ success: true, data: posts });
};

// 4. Add route (1 minute)
// blog/routes.ts
route.get('/', listPosts);

// Done! Visit http://localhost:2000/blog`
  }
  lang='ts'
  title={'app'}
/>


Five minutes from idea to working endpoint. That's the StratusTS way.
